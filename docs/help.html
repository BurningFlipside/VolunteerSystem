<h2 id="setup-wizard">Setup Wizard</h2>
<p>The first time you open the Flipside Volunteer System (FVS), you'll be asked a series of questions to set up your profile. It starts with <em>Basic Info</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/FlipsideVolunteerWizardBasic.jpg" alt="Wizard Basic" /></p>
<p>Enter your burner name, the camp you're with (if any), and select a shirt size.<br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> The shirt size is for future reference, and is in no way a guarantee that you are going to receive a shirt!</p>
<p>Click <em>Next</em> to advance to the next screen.</p>
<p>The <em>Legal Name</em> screen asks for your legal name.</p>
<p><img src="images/FlipsideVolunteerWizardLegal.jpg" alt="Wizard Legal" /></p>
<p>Enter your legal first and last names. Legal names are a requirement for some privileges. If you're volunteering for a role that will grant you early access or late stays, AAR, LLC has to have your legal name. If you do not wish to provide your legal name, some volunteer shifts will not show.</p>
<p>Click <em>Next</em> to advance to the next screen.</p>
<p>In the <em>Privacy Settings</em> screen, you can select how your information is displayed online, and on paper.</p>
<p>Use the list menus to select how you wish your name to appear.</p>
<p><img src="images/FlipsideVolunteerWizardPrivacy.jpg" alt="Wizard Privacy" /></p>
<p>Click <em>Next</em> to advance to the final screen of the wizard.</p>
<p>Enter your email address in the <em>Communications</em> screen. Be sure that it is an email you have access to, and check regularly! Communications about your volunteer activities will go here, so make sure you've entered the address correctly.</p>

<p>Click <em>Complete</em> to finish the wizard and see the Flipside Volunteer System in action.</p>
<h2 id="flipside-volunteer-system-dashboard">Flipside Volunteer System Dashboard</h2>
<p>The basic dashboard has a lot of parts, so let's go through what you'll see if you volunteered for a Work Weekend with Site Prep.</p>
<p><img src="images/BasicDashboard.jpg" alt="Basic Dashboard" /></p>
<h3 id="events">Events</h3>
<p>Use the <em>Event</em> list menu to select which event you're looking to volunteer for. In this example, it's Work Weekend 1.<br />The departments that have shifts available are listed in the <em>Departments</em> field. Because work weekends are only under Site Prep, that's the only department listed.</p>
<p>For a more complicated example, here's how it looks for Burning Flipside itself:<br /><img src="images/SafetyShifts.jpg" alt="Flipside Dashboard" /></p>
<p>You can click the <strong>x</strong> next to the department name if you don't want to see that department's shifts, or you can add departments by selecting them from the list menu. Items that are gray in the list menu have already been selected.</p>
<h3 id="shift-status">Shift Status</h3>
<p>Shifts are color-coded to help you easily see what is available or not.</p>
<table>

<tr class="header">

<tr class="odd">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Click the shift you want to pick up (remember, it'll be blue).</p>
<p>You're presented with information about the shift you've selected, including the department, what role you have, and the start/end times. You'll also see just how many hours you've signed on for.</p>
<p>Click <em>Signup</em> to officially sign up for the shift. When you see the <em>Success!</em> prompt, click <em>OK</em> to go back to the dashboard.</p>
